    "- Since the option has negative Gamma, from the formula that $C_{KK}\\leq 0$, meaning that the option is concave in strike.\n",
    "- We can do a convexity arbitrage: Buy an option with a strike price slightly below the current price, sell two options at the current price, and buy an option with a strike price slightly above the current price. This position gives us non-negative initial cash flow, and the payoff has positive probability that in the future we will have a positive payoff. Hence this constructs a butterfly arbitrage."
