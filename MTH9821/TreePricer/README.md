# TreePricer
Binomial and trinomial tree pricer for European and American options. Adaptation to other exotic (single asset) derivative is possible. This pricer is special in that it supports any number of discrete dividends (proportional and/or fixed) in any order.

This is the first of the three numeric option pricers to be created. (Tree, Monte Carlo, and finite difference)

At this moment, this pricer is mostly functional. Further development is expected to be incremental.

Stars are always welcome :D
